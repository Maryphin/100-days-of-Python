# 100-days-of-Python
I am making the commitment to do a different project each day based on the 100 days of code challenge by Angela Yu. I also commit to challenging myself by building additional projects to deepen my understanding and grow as a Python programmer.
100 Days of Code, building consistency and progress one project at a time.
